[Github Repository](https://github.com/DigiMatChem/paper-ml-with-lobster-descriptors) 

`mlproject` is a package that hosts all the utility scripts to reproduce the results from our publication *Assessment of quantum-chemical bonding descriptors predictive ability*. 
For the sake of brevitiy, some results are not included in the publication, this repository also presents all those results.
